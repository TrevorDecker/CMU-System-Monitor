    <h1>Description of Lab</h1> <a href="files/description.pdf">pdf</a>
    <p class="content">
      The purpose of this lab is to climb real human size stairs with a robot using 
      the NXT and Lego set only. The robot will have to climb the staircase inside Gates 4401 Rashid Auditorium.
       The grading will be based on how high you can carry a 
      golf ball up the stair case. Throwing is not allowed, but arms that are 
      attached to the robot are permitted. The location of the golf ball at the end
	  of the run will determine the stair the robot has reached. For the golf ball to be “on” 
	  a stair, the entirety of the ball must have crossed the frontmost vertical plane of the stair.<br />
Grading will take place in Rashid. There will
be grading runs on both flights, followed by a head-to-head competition round, time permitting. Your
grade will be based on the number of stairs your robot is able to climb, and has nothing to do with the
actual place in the competition. Climbing 3+ stairs is worth full credit, regardless of competition
performance.<br />
The competition is a head to head tournament, with brackets determined by the results of the
grading. The robot that carries the ball to the nth highest point with be nth seed. In case of ties, the
faster robot will win. The top four teams will be placed on the stair case in groups of two, and the robot
that climbs the farthest in 1 minute will be the winner.<br />
